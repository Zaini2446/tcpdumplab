# Running TCP dump and Sniffing Network Traffic

This guide will show you how to run TCP dump and sniff network traffic.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux virtual machine with tcpdump installed
- Basic knowledge of the Linux terminal

## Steps

#### Step 1: Start Your Linux Virtual Machine and Open two Terminals
 - Start your Linux virtual machine.
 - Open two terminal windows. (You should now have two terminal windows open side-by-side.
 - One terminal will be used to capture traffic using tcpdump
 - The second terminal will be used to generate traffic using the ping command.

#### Step 2: View the interfaces on which you can start sniffing network traffic
 - Run this command to view the availble interfaces:
```bash
sudo tcpdump -d
```

#### Step 3: Start tcpdump to have it sniff your loopback (lo). 

- Write the following command to have tcpdump sniff your loopback (lo):
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i lo
```

- **-i**: allows us to specify that we want to sniff on the loopback (lo) interface.
- This terminal will now hang wile the sniffer is running and will display captured packets onto the screen as they are received.

#### Step 4: Use your other terminal window to run the ping command against your loopback (lo) interface. 

- Write the following command to run a ping scan against your loopback (lo) interface:
```bash
ping 127.0.0.1 -c 1
```

- **127.0.0.1**: is the IP address of your loopback (lo) interface.
- **-c 1**: allows us to send only one ICMP Echo request.
- As you can see, tcpdump has successfully sniffed the traffic that was generated by the ping command on our second terminal.
- Lets analyze how tcpdump has presented the sniffed data:
  - **On the left (15:40:00)**: we can identify the timestamp of when the packet was captured.
  - **IP**: tells us the protocol that was used. (in this case, it is the Internet Protocol)
  - **localhost > localhost**: is the source & destination of the packet.
